** Fronend for anonymization endpoint **

## Overview

The frontend should add a nice minimalistic UI to the anonymization endpoint.
The underlying service has two endpoints:
- https://anonymizer.go-data.at/api/anonymization
- https://anonymizer.go-data.at/api/anonymization/flatjson
The first endpoint is used for the anonymization of json-ld the second one is used for flat json

## UI
The UI should be minimalistic and easy to use.
It should have a file input field and a button to start the anonymization.
The two endpoints should be clearly separated.
